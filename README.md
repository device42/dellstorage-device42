This code will read storage array info from Dell Storage Enterprise Manager using REST and then send the data back to Device42.

It can be run with './dellstorage-device42.py' and expects a config file in the same directory named 'dellstorage-device42.cfg'

Tested with Python 2.7 and Dell Storage Enterprise Manager 2015 R3
